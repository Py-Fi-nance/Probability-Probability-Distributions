## Function Definitions

Here, define the key probability functions used in the notebook:

- simple_probability(event_outcomes, total_outcomes): Calculate the simple probability of an event.
- addition_rule(prob_A, prob_B, prob_A_and_B): Implement the addition rule for probabilities.
- conditional_probability(prob_A_and_B, prob_B): Define the conditional probability function.
- bayes_theorem(prob_A, prob_B_given_A, prob_B): Implement Bayes' Theorem.

## Probability Distribution Examples

Discuss different types of probability distributions and provide examples:

- **Binomial Distribution:** Calculate probabilities and expected values for binomial variables.
- **Poisson Distribution:** Model the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval of time or space.
- **Normal Distribution:** Understand the properties of normal distribution and calculate probabilities for different ranges of a normally distributed variable.
- **Exponential Distribution:** Model the time between events in a Poisson point process.
- **Weibull Distribution:** Understand the Weibull distribution for reliability analysis.
